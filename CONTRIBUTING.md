# Contributing

If you find something wrong or want to add another company please **contribute with a pull request**.

Please make sure the following company details are provided:
* Category;
* Name;
* Website (linked from the company's name);
* Careers website, if exists (linked from the :rocket:);
* Very short description;
* List of portuguese locations (which may contain `Remote` if the company allows remote work).

Some additional things to keep in mind:
* The company must allow working in/from Portugal;
* Both links are valid;
* Both links use HTTPS, if available;
* The description starts with uppercase, ends with a `.` period and fits in a single line (to improve readability);
* Locations must be written in their portuguese names (e.g. use `Lisboa` instead of `Lisbon`);
* Locations must be enclosed in an inline code block (using with backtick quotes `` ` ``) and separated by spaces;
* Locations should be separated by a `<br>` at least every 2 locations to keep the table column width under control;
* Both companies and locations are ordered alphabetically (except the special `Remote` location that must appear last);
* If a new category is required please provide an explanation in the commit message.

Thanks for contributing!
