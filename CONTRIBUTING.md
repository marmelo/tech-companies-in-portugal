# Contributing

If you find something wrong or want to add another company please **contribute with a pull request**.

Please make sure the following company details are provided:
* Name;
* Website (linked from the company's name);
* Careers website, if exists (linked from the :rocket:);
* Very short description;
* List of portuguese locations (which may contain `Remote` if the company allows remote work).

Some additional things to keep in mind:
* Each company should only refer to a single company;
* The company must allow working in/from Portugal;
* Both links are valid;
* Both links use HTTPS, if available;
* The description starts with uppercase, ends with a `.` period and fits in a single line (to improve readability);
* Locations must be enclosed in an inline code block (using with backtick quotes `` ` ``) and separated by spaces; 
* Both companies and locations are ordered alphabetically (except the special `Remote` location that must appear last);

Thanks for contributing!
