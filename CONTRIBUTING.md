# Contributing

If you find something wrong or want to add another company please **contribute with a pull request**.

Please make sure the following company details are provided:
* Category;
* Name;
* Website (linked from the company's name);
* Careers website, if exists (linked from the :rocket:);
* Github account, or another git-repository manager account, if exists and contains at least one relevant and active repository (linked from the :octocat:);
* Very short description;
* List of portuguese locations (which may contain `Remote` if the company allows remote work).

Below you can find an example of how to add a company:
| Company | Description | Locations |
| :------ | :---------- | :-------- |
| [Example](https://example.com/) [:rocket:](https://www.example.com/careers) [:octocat:](https://github.com/example) | Example revolutionises the way people write examples. | `Example City` |

Some additional things to keep in mind:
* The company must allow working in/from Portugal;
  * Fully remove companies might also fit here if either is true:
    * Career page explicitly mentions that it hires remote people from PT / EU;
    * There are PT engineers already working remotely for said company;
* Listed offices must have development/tech jobs positions (e.g. a location with only HR functions should not be listed);
* Both links must be valid/working;
* Both links should be HTTPS, if available;
* Mailto links are not allowed;
* Referral links are not allowed;
* The description starts with uppercase, ends with a `.` period and fits in a single line (70 chars max);
* Locations must be written in their portuguese names (e.g. use `Lisboa` instead of `Lisbon`);
* Locations must be enclosed in an inline code block (using with backtick quotes `` ` ``) and separated by spaces;
* Locations should be separated by a `<br>` at least every 2 locations to keep the table column width under control;
* Both companies and locations are ordered alphabetically (except the special `Remote` location that must appear last);
* If a new category is required please provide an explanation in the commit message;
* If a company would fit in multiple categories, only the one category that fits best must be selected.

Thanks for contributing!
